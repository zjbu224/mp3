1. duplicated code. we can fix by extracting the code into its own method.
2. feature envy. we should just move it to a class that fits it better.
3. code like that should be inside a for loop.
4. the majority of code in RunParameterDefinitionTest.java was repeated with a different parameter being used. we can extract the repeated code to a different function and use that as reference.
